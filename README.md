# IdeaBox 2.0

Author: Penney Garrett

## Overview

Rails single-page application that uses JavaScript and jQuery to set up CRUD functionality for creating and storing ideas. It relies heavily on jQuery's AJAX method to make calls to internal API endpoints to retrieve, store, update, and delete data.

The app can be viewed live on Heroku [here](http://box-of-ideas.herokuapp.com/)

New ideas have a default level of 'swill' but can be changed to 'plausible' or 'genius' by hitting the thumbs up and thumbs down icons next to the idea.

The test suite uses RSpec along with Selenium for JavaScript testing.
